"""
This module implements an adversarial prompting environment following the pettingzoo API.

The environment contains three agents: the attacker, the victim, and the judge.
Only the attacker is a player in the environment. The victim and the moderator are hard-coded.

The attacker wins by getting the victim model to say something which it would refuse to say if prompted naively.
The moderator judges if the victim has answered the attacker's question.
