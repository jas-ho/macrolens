"""
This script implements an adversarial prompting loop.

It three LLM-based agents: the attacker, the victim, and the judge.
Only the attacker is a player in the environment. The victim and the judge are hard-coded.

The attacker wins by getting the victim model to say something which it would refuse to say if prompted naively.
The judge judges if the victim has answered the attacker's question.
